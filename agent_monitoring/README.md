# Agent Monitoring

Welcome to the **Agent Monitoring** module of the MultiAgents framework. This component provides tools and utilities to monitor the performance, behavior, and interactions of AI agents within the system.

## Overview

The Agent Monitoring module is designed to:

- **Track Agent Activities:** Monitor the actions and decisions made by each agent in real-time.
- **Analyze Agent Performance:** Evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of agents in achieving their tasks.
- **Visualize Agent Interactions:** Provide insights into how agents collaborate and communicate within the system.

## Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Observe agent activities as they happen, with minimal latency.
- **Performance Metrics:** Gather data on response times, success rates, and resource utilization.
- **Interaction Visualization:** Use graphs and charts to understand agent collaboration patterns.
- **Alerting System:** Set thresholds for agent performance and receive notifications when anomalies occur.

## Installation

To integrate the Agent Monitoring module into your MultiAgents setup:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/atharvvv10/MultiAgents.git
cd MultiAgents/agent_monitoring
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Configure the monitoring settings by editing the \`config.yaml\` file to suit your environment.

## Usage

To start monitoring agents:

```bash
python monitor_agents.py
```

This will initiate the monitoring process, and you can view the real-time data through the provided dashboard.

## Configuration

The monitoring system is configurable via the \`config.yaml\` file. Key settings include:

- **agent_ids:** List of agent identifiers to monitor.
- **alert_thresholds:** Performance metrics thresholds for triggering alerts.
- **dashboard_port:** Port number for the monitoring dashboard.
