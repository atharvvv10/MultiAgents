# MultiAgents LLM Project

Welcome to the MultiAgents LLM Project This repository showcases the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into the MultiAgents framework, enabling the development of intelligent agents capable of performing complex tasks through natural language understanding and generation.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The llm_project module extends the capabilities of the MultiAgents framework by incorporating LLMs, allowing agents to:

- Understand and process natural language inputs
- Generate human-like responses
- Perform tasks that require reasoning and contextual understanding
- Collaborate with other agents to accomplish complex objectives

## 📁 Project Structure

```bash
MultiAgents/
└── llm_project/
    ├── src/            # Core source code for LLM-powered agent functionalities
    ├── demo/           # Sample demonstrations and usage examples
    └── tests/          # Unit and integration tests
```

- **\`src/\`**: Main implementation of LLM-powered agents.
- **\`demo/\`**: Example scripts to demonstrate agent usage.
- **\`tests/\`**: Test cases for reliability and correctness.
