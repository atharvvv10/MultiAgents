# MultiAgents AI Agent

Welcome to the **MultiAgents AI Agent** project! This repository provides a foundational framework for building and managing AI agents capable of performing specific tasks autonomously. It's designed to be modular, scalable, and easy to integrate with various applications.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The \`ai-agent\` module serves as the core component of the MultiAgents framework. It encapsulates the logic for creating intelligent agents that can:

- Execute predefined tasks
- Interact with other agents
- Process and analyze data
- Adapt to new situations through learning

## 📁 Project Structure

Here's an overview of the project's directory structure:

\`\`\`
MultiAgents/
└── ai-agent/
    ├── src/            # Core source code for agent functionalities
    ├── demo/           # Sample demonstrations and usage examples
    └── tests/          # Unit and integration tests
\`\`\`

- **\`src/\`**: Contains the main implementation of the AI agent, including algorithms, data processing, and communication protocols.
- **\`demo/\`**: Provides example scripts to demonstrate how to initialize and interact with the agent.
- **\`tests/\`**: Includes test cases to ensure the reliability and correctness of the agent's functionalities.

## 🛠️ Installation

To get started with the MultiAgents AI Agent, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

\`\`\`bash
git clone https://github.com/atharvvv10/MultiAgents.git
cd MultiAgents/ai-agent
\`\`\`

2. Install the required dependencies:

\`\`\`bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
\`\`\`

*(Ensure you have Python 3.8+ and pip installed.)*

## 🚀 Usage

After setting up the environment, you can test the agent using the provided demo script:

\`\`\`bash
python demo/run_demo.py
\`\`\`

This script will initialize the agent and execute a series of tasks to showcase its capabilities.

## 🧪 Running Tests

To ensure everything is functioning correctly, run the tests using:

\`\`\`bash
pytest tests/
\`\`\`

This will execute all the test cases and report any issues.
